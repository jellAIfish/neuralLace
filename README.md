# neuralLace

## Why
If you asked us `Why are you building a closed source neural lace?`. 
We would respond using Hunter's Principle.

Right now there are 4 contradictory approaches to building super human level AI.

A) Open AI
B) Numenta
C) Vicarious
D) Kenerel.co & us

TODO: show Vicarious has the best strategy for building code based human level AI. 

If Vicarious succeeded they would not be able to control a super human level AI. 
Q understand's Hunter's Principle but still eats Meat. Therefore a code based human level AI is not
guranteed to help humanity. Therefore humans themsleves must become the super human level AI.

The fastest current path is to increase human output through a device known as a neural lace.
