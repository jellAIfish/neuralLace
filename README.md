## Why and Goals
If u asked us `Why are u building a closed source neural lace?`.
We would respond using [Hunter's Principle](https://youtu.be/lsFYMO4dfhc).

Right now there are 4 contradictory approaches to building super human level AI.

A) Open AI = open source machine learning  
B) Numenta = open source biological prediction model  
C) Vicarious = closed source high order graphical models  
D) Kenerel.co & Neurallink ~= neural lace

Hunter's Principle combined with the [history of AI](https://github.com/markroxor/neuralLace/issues/15) show that approach C by
Vicarious is closet to building strong AI.

If Vicarious succeeded they would not be able to control a super human level AI.
While being interviewed by Scott Phoenix(cofounder of Vicarious) q asked him
what they would do if they achieved strong AI. He replied that it would be up
to the strong AI. <b>This is a problem because a code based super intelligent
AI will not be able to be controlled by us and is most likely not going to help
humanity.</b> Just look at how humans treat animals with less intelligence.

One solution is for humans to upgrade themselves and become the super human AI.
Now the question becomes `How do u increase human intelligence by orders of magnitude safely?`

If intelligence is defined by an object with the illusion of free will with the
ability to predict the future and act on it in a way that is beneficial to
itself and others then we can increase intelligence several ways.

Option 1) increase range & accuracy of future predictions  
Option 2) increase speed at which u can act on the world  
Option 3) increase win win situations u can create for urself and other intelligent agents in the world

## How

`How to increase option 1?`  
- 10x improvement by sleeping better
- 10x improvement by eating better
- 10x improvement by having better relationships
- 10x improvement by constantly learning more truths about the world from the worlds actual experts
- 10x improvement by removing distractions such as social media
- 10x improvement by removing collecting materails u don't actually need in ur life
- 10x improvement by using a neural lace

`How to increase option 2?`
- 10x improvement by eating better
- 10x improvement by sleeping better
- 10x improvement by removing distractions such as social media
- 10x improvement by accumulating passive income
- 10x improvement by using a neural lace

`How to increase option 3?`
- 10x improvement by thinking when u need something what service can u create that will help u and someone else?

Now using a neural lace increases option 1 and 2 and doesn't yet exist so how do we build one?

`How to build a neural lace?`  
A) insert mesh electronics into a specific area of the human brain to be able to read it's thoughts

#### How to interview
Ask them the following series of questions:
1. `Can I record this interview for others in the company to listen to?`
2. `Tell me the story of ur life and how u solved the hardest problem in ur life.`
3. `What do u believe that very few people believe?`. Reason is because it
   shows they are critical thinkers.
4. In judging their response use ur gut instinct.
