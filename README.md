## Why and Goals
Many groups are trying to build strong AI. However we beleive strong AI should not be built because:

1. Humans are the domaint species on Earth because of our intelligence.
2. If we make another species (code based strong AI) smarter than us then there is no way for us to control it 
   because it is more intelligent than all of humanity combined.
3. There is a very high chance that it will use humans for purposes we do not want. Look at how we treat species 
   that are less intelligent than us.
4. We cannot stop the humans that are researching strong AI so one solution is to increase human intelligence.

One solution is for humans to upgrade themselves and become the super human AI.
Now the question becomes `How do u increase human intelligence by orders of magnitude safely?`

If intelligence is defined by an object with the illusion of free will with the ability to <b>predict the future</b> and 
<b>act on it</b> in a way that is <b>beneficial to itself and others</b> then we can increase intelligence several ways.

Option 1) increase range & accuracy of future predictions  
Option 2) increase speed at which u can act on the world  
Option 3) increase win win situations u can create for urself and other intelligent agents in the world
