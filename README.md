## Why and Goals
If u asked us `Why are u building a closed source neural lace?`.
We would respond using [Hunter's Principle](https://youtu.be/lsFYMO4dfhc).

Right now there are 4 contradictory approaches to building super human level AI.

A) Open AI = open source machine learning  
B) Numenta = open source biological prediction model  
C) Vicarious = closed source high order graphical models  
D) Kenerel.co & Neurallink ~= neural lace

Hunter's Principle combined with the [history of AI](https://github.com/markroxor/neuralLace/issues/15) show that approach C by
Vicarious is closet to building strong AI.

If Vicarious succeeded they would not be able to control a super human level AI.
While being interviewed by Scott Phoenix(cofounder of Vicarious) q asked him
what they would do if they achieved strong AI. He replied that it would be up
to the strong AI. <b>This is a problem because a code based super intelligent human
level AI will not be able to be controlled and is not guranteed to help
humanity.</b> Just look at how humans treat animals with less intelligence.

One solution is for humans to upgrade themselves and become the super human AI.
Now the question becomes `How do u increase human intelligence by orders of magnitude safely?`

A) Build a neural lace to increase human intelligence
B) Recode human genome while human is alive to increase intelligence

Intelligence definition = an object with the illusion of free will with the
ability to predict the future and act on it in a way that is beneficial to
itself and others.

Building a neural lace and injecting it into the human brain to allow bandwidth
between the cortex and a computer to increase thereby also increasing human's
ability to act on the world by an order of magnitude faster.

## How

#### How to interview
Ask them the following series of questions:
0) `Can I record this interview for others in the company to listen to?`
1) `Tell me the story of ur life and how u solved the hardest problem in ur life.`
2) `What do u believe that very few people believe?`. Reason is because it
   shows they are critical thinkers.
3) In judging their response use ur gut instinct.
