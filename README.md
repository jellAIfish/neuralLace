# neuralLace

## Why
If you asked us `Why are you building a closed source neural lace?`. 
We would respond using [Hunter's Principle](https://youtu.be/lsFYMO4dfhc).

Right now there are 4 contradictory approaches to building super human level AI.

A) Open AI = open source machine learning
B) Numenta = open source biological prediction model
C) Vicarious = closed source high order graphical models
D) Kenerel.co & Neurallink ~= neural lace

Hunter's Principle combined with the history of AI show that approach C by Vicarious is closet to 
building strong AI.

If Vicarious succeeded they would not be able to control a super human level AI. While being
interviewed by Scott Phoenix(cofounder of Vicarious) q asked him what they would do if they
achieved strong AI. He replied that it would be up to the strong AI. This is a problem because
a code based super intelligent human level AI will not be able to be controlled and is not
guranteed to help humanity. Just look at how humans treat animals with less intelligence. 

One solution is for humans to upgrade themselves and become the super human AI. Now the 
question becomes `How do you increase human intelligence safely?`

A) Build a neural lace to increase human output levels
B) Recode human genome while human is alive to increase intelligence

Intelligence definition = an object with the illusion of free will with the ability to predict the future and act on it in a way that is beneficial to itself and others
